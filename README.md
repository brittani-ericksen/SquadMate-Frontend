<h3>SquadMate is an application built to complete online forms by team members for organizers responsible for those teams. The application gathers information on member registration, medical information needs for events and any other information needed to be prepared for the events.<h3>

<h3>The motivation behind the application design was to assist people in need of assistance in areas where managers and coaches work with teams of minors for an event/tournament/match. An easy accessible function to complete the required forms necessary by parents of minors participating in team events. The ability to link information to medics (and other) in absence of the parents with the focus of being prepared.<h3>
